## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.85+ (2024 edition)
- cpdb-libs C library installed on your system
- Git

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpdb-rs.git
   cd cpdb-rs
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-rs.git
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Check formatting
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Run clippy
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Build documentation
cargo doc --no-deps --open
```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow Rust naming conventions
- Use `cargo fmt` to format code
- Use `cargo clippy` to catch common issues
- Write comprehensive documentation
- Add tests for new functionality

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add printer options support
fix: handle null pointer in settings
docs: update README with new examples
test: add unit tests for media handling
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature"
   ```

3. Push your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create a pull request on GitHub

5. Ensure all CI checks pass

6. Address any review feedback

### Testing Requirements

- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Add integration tests for complex features
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Test on multiple platforms when possible

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add doc comments for public APIs
- Include examples in documentation
- Update CHANGELOG.md for significant changes

## Release Process

Releases are managed by maintainers. Since this project is structured as a workspace, **`cpdb-sys` must be published to crates.io before `cpdb-rs`**.

1. Update the version in `cpdb-sys/Cargo.toml`.
2. Update the version in `Cargo.toml` (both for `cpdb-rs` package version and the `cpdb-sys` dependency version in `[dependencies]`).
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Create a release tag (e.g., `v0.1.0`).
5. Publish `cpdb-sys` first:

```bash
cd cpdb-sys
cargo publish
```

6. Publish `cpdb-rs`:

```bash
cargo publish
```

7. Create the GitHub release.
